The objective of this code is to train a YOLOv8n model for image recognition 

There is 3 python file in this repository, and is for different purpose

"CV_training.py" is to train the yolov8n model.
the code will first load a COCO-pretrained YOLOv8n model, and place a copy of original model in folder "model_original"
after that, it will perform training using the training data placed in folder "training data"
the trained model will be exported to folder "model" for use

"CV_testing.py" is to test the yolov8n model.
The code will use the testing data in folder "test_data" to test the accuracy of the model
the code will also test the model efficiency in terms of time used for inference

"CV_prediction.py" is to use the yolov8n model in deployment.
In final deployment, only the model and this code will be provided.
The user will provide an image. the model will perform image recognition, and output a list of possible labels with their respective possibilities

The package that is needed to be installed should be placed in requirement.txt
